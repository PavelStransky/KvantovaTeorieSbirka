After some historical notes on the first attempts for the numerical evaluation of LCEs, we discuss in detail the multiplicative ergodic theorem of Oseledec [102], which provides the theoretical basis for the computation of the LCEs. Then, we analyze the algorithm for the computation of the maximal LCE, whose value has been extensively used as an indicator of chaos, and the algorithm of the so-called standard method, developed by Benettin et al. [14], for the computation of many LCEs. We also consider different discrete and continuous methods for computing the LCEs based on the QR or the singular value decomposition techniques. Although we are mainly interested in finite-dimensional conservative systems, i.e., autonomous Hamiltonian systems and symplectic maps, we also briefly refer to the evaluation of LCEs of dissipative systems and time series. The relation of two chaos detection techniques, namely the fast Lyapunov indicator (FLI) and the generalized alignment index (GALI), to the computation of the LCEs is also discussed.},doi = {10.1007/978-3-642-04458-8_2},file = {:Skokos2010 - The Lyapunov Characteristic Exponents and Their Computation.pdf:PDF},keywords = {Hamiltonian System, Lyapunov Exponent, Singular Value Decomposition, Deviation Vector, Wedge Product},url = {https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04458-8_2},urldate = {2022-12-08},}

Additionally, we propose the negativity of the tripartite information of the channel as a general diagnostic of scrambling. This measures the delocalization of information and is closely related to the decay of out-of-time-order correlators. We back up our results with numerics in two non-integrable models and analytic results in a perfect tensor network model of chaotic time evolution.

In this context, two-fluid algebraic models are ideal systems to study how the concept of quantum phase transition evolves when moving into more complex systems, but the number of publications along this line has been scarce up to now.Purpose: We intend to determine the phase diagram of a two-fluid Lipkin model that resembles the nuclear proton-neutron interacting boson model Hamiltonian using both numerical results and analytic tools, i.e., catastrophe theory, and compare the mean-field results with exact diagonalizations for large systems.Method: The mean-field energy surface of a consistent-Q-like two-fluid Lipkin Hamiltonian is studied and compared with exact results coming from a direct diagonalization. The mean-field results are analyzed using the framework of catastrophe theory.Results: The phase diagram of the model is obtained and the order of the different phase-transition lines and surfaces is determined using a catastrophe theory analysis.Conclusions: There are two first-order surfaces in the phase diagram, one separating the spherical and the deformed shapes, while the other separates two different deformed phases. A second-order line, where the later surfaces merge, is found. This line finishes in a transition point with a divergence in the second-order derivative of the energy that corresponds to a tricritical point in the language of the Ginzburg-Landau theory for phase transitions.},comment = {220525 - read},doi = {10.1103/PhysRevC.93.034336},file = {:GarciaRamos2016 - Phase Diagram of the Two Fluid Lipkin Model_ a _butterfly_ Catastrophe.pdf:PDF},keywords = {two-fluid Lipkin, phase structure, QPT, Morse theorem, Thom splitting lemma},publisher = {American Physical Society ({APS})},}

Such optimal protocols are shown to be geodesics on the parameter manifold, maximizing the local fidelity. Physically, such protocols minimize the average energy fluctuations along the path.

However, when an isolated quantum system itself is a many-body quantum system, the question of how large and complex it must be in order to generate internal equilibration is an open key-point in the literature. In this work, by monitoring the degree of equilibration of a single spin through its purity degradation, we are able to sense the chaotic behaviour of the generic spin chain to which it is coupled. Quite remarkably, this holds even in the case of extremely short spin chains composed of three spins, where we can also reproduce the whole integrable to chaos transition. Finally, we discuss implications on quantum control experiments and show that quantum chaos reigns over the best degree of control achieved, even in small chains.},archiveprefix = {arXiv},eprint = {2006.14468},file = {:Mirkin2020 - Quantum Chaos, Equilibration and Control in Extremely Short Spin Chains.pdf:PDF},keywords = {Mexico 2021, spin system, NNS},primaryclass = {quant-ph},}

In particular, its rate of possible exponential growth at ℏ→0 is closely related to the classical Lyapunov exponent. Here we explore how this approach to quantum chaos relates to the random-matrix theoretical description. To do so, we introduce and study the level statistics of the logarithm of the out-of-time-ordered operator, ˆΛ(t)=ln(−[ˆx(t),ˆpx(0)]2)/(2t), that we dub the “Lyapunovian” or “Lyapunov operator” for brevity. The Lyapunovian's level statistics is calculated explicitly for the quantum stadium billiard. It is shown that in the bulk of the filtered spectrum, this statistics perfectly aligns with the Wigner-Dyson distribution. One of the advantages of looking at the spectral statistics of this operator is that it has a well-defined semiclassical limit where it reduces to the matrix of uncorrelated classical finite-time Lyapunov exponents in a partitioned phase space. We provide a heuristic picture interpolating these two limits using Moyal quantum mechanics. Our results show that the Lyapunov operator may serve as a useful tool to characterize quantum chaos and in particular quantum-to-classical correspondence in chaotic systems by connecting the semiclassical Lyapunov growth at early times, when the quantum effects are weak, to universal level repulsion that hinges on strong quantum interference effects.},doi = {10.1103/PhysRevB.100.035112},file = {:Rozenbaum2019 - Universal Level Statistics of the Out of Time Ordered Operator.pdf:PDF},keywords = {OTOC, quantum chaos, Lyapunovian, NNSD},publisher = {American Physical Society ({APS})},}

To start with we treat one-dimensional problems and discuss the derivation of WKB connection formulae (and their reversibility), reflection coefficients, phase shifts, bound state criteria and resonance formulae, employing first the complex method in which the classical turning points are avoided, and secondly the method of comparison equations with the aid of which uniform approximations are derived, which are valid right through the turningpoint regions. The special problems associated with radial equations are also considered. Next we examine semiclassical potential scattering, both for its own sake and also as an example of the three-stage approximation method which must generally be employed when dealing with eigenfunction expansions under semiclassical conditions, when they converge very slowly. Finally, we discuss the derivation of semiclassical expressions for Green functions and energy level densities in very general cases, employing Feynman's path-integral technique and emphasizing the limitations of the results obtained. Throughout the article we stress the fact that all the expressions obtained involve quantities characterizing the families of orbits in the corresponding purely classical problems, while the analytic forms of the quantal expressions depend on the topological properties of these families.This review was completed in February 1972.},comment = {20210414 - cited by Deunff2013},doi = {10.1088/0034-4885/35/1/306},file = {:Berry1972 - Semiclassical Approximations in Wave Mechanics.pdf:PDF},keywords = {WKB, complex turning points, Stokes lines},publisher = {{IOP} Publishing},url = {https://doi.org/10.1088/0034-4885/35/1/306},}

The model physical system we consider may be viewed as a particular case of the generalized time-dependent harmonic oscillator, or as a generalization of the degenerate parametric amplifier, with the pumping field having modulated amplitude and a nonresonant phase. A Hamiltonian of such a system is given as a linear combination of the SU(1,1) generators with time-dependent coefficients, and the group transformations, mentioned above, transform this Hamiltonian to an expression containing only one generator, i.e. diagonalize the Hamiltonian. Trajectories of the complex coherent state parameter in the phase space (Lobachevskii plane) can be divided into two classes: compact trajectories never approaching the unit circle (boundary of the phase space) and noncompact trajectories approaching the unit circle from inside asymptotically, after sufficiently long time. The character of the dynamics is reflected by the time behaviour of the parameters of the group transformation diagonalizing the Hamiltonian. The main observation is that in the case of noncompact dynamics absolute values of the group parameters increase indefinitely, although in some cases they may exhibit a singular behaviour with regions of rapid variations, sudden changes of their values or cusplike singularities. For compact dynamics the group transformation parameters remain bounded and exhibit an oscillatory behaviour as functions of time.},comment = {20210414 - reference from Novaes2004},doi = {10.1088/0305-4470/34/39/309},file = {:Bechler2001 - Compact and Noncompact Dynamics of TheSU(1,1) Coherent States Driven by a Coherence Preserving Hamiltonian.pdf:PDF},keywords = {SU(1, 1) coherent states, classical dynamics},publisher = {{IOP} Publishing},url = {https://doi.org/10.1088/0305-4470/34/39/309},}

Yet experiments in quantum simulators have now opened up a route towards the generation of quantum states beyond this equilibrium paradigm. While these states promise to show properties not constrained by equilibrium principles, such as the equal a priori probability of the microcanonical ensemble, identifying the general properties of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics remains a major challenge, especially in view of the lack of conventional concepts such as free energies. The theory of dynamical quantum phase transitions attempts to identify such general principles by lifting the concept of phase transitions to coherent quantum real-time evolution. This review provides a pedagogical introduction to this field. Starting from the general setting of nonequilibrium dynamics in closed quantum many-body systems, we give the definition of dynamical quantum phase transitions as phase transitions in time with physical quantities becoming nonanalytic at critical times.

In the quantum theory they are represented by the self-adjoint Lie algebra generators K0, K1, and K2 of a unitary representation, where K0 has the spectrum {k + n, n = 0, 1, ...; k > 0}. A crucial prediction is that the classical Pythagorean relation h12 + h22 = h02 can be violated in the quantum theory. For each representation one can define three different types of coherent states the complex phases of which may be “measured” by means of the operators K1 and K2 alone without introducing any new phase operators! The SO(1,2) structure of optical squeezing and interference properties as well as that of the harmonic oscillator are analyzed in detail. The additional coherent states can be used for the introduction of (Husimi type) “Q” distributions and (Sudarshan-Glauber type) “P” representations of the density operator. The three operators K0, K1, and K2 are fundamental in the sense that one can construct composite position and momentum operators out of them!

Recently, substantial progress was achieved in enhancing the time within which a solid-state qubit demonstrates coherent dynamics. This progress is based mostly on a successful isolation of the qubits from external decoherence sources obtained by engineering. Under these conditions, the material-inherent sources of noise start to play a crucial role. In most cases, quantum devices are affected by noise decreasing with frequency f approximately as 1/f. According to the present point of view, such noise is due to material- and device-specific microscopic degrees of freedom interacting with quantum variables of the nanodevice. The simplest picture is that the environment that destroys the phase coherence of the device can be thought of as a system of two-state fluctuators, which experience random hops between their states. If the hopping times are distributed in an exponentially broad domain, the resulting fluctuations have a spectrum close to 1/f in a large frequency range. This paper reviews the current state of the theory of decoherence due to degrees of freedom producing 1/f noise. Basic mechanisms of such noises in various nanodevices are discussed and several models describing the interaction of the noise sources with quantum devices are reviewed. The main focus of the review is to analyze how the 1/f noise destroys their coherent operation. The start is from individual qubits concentrating mostly on the devices based on superconductor circuits and then some special issues related to more complicated architectures are discussed.

It is as relevant for unmasking the dynamics of neurons in noisy environments as it is for designing reliable nanoscale logic circuit elements and sensors. Most studies of noise in nonlinear devices are limited to either time-correlated noise with a Lorentzian spectrum (of which the white noise is a limiting case) or just white noise. We use analytical theory and numerical simulations to study the impact of the more ubiquitous “natural” noise with a 1/f frequency spectrum. Specifically, we study the impact of the 1/f noise on a leaky integrate and fire model of a neuron. The impact of noise is considered on two quantities of interest to neuron function: The spike count Fano factor and the speed of neuron response to a small steplike stimulus. For the perfect (nonleaky) integrate and fire model, we show that the Fano factor can be expressed as an integral over noise spectrum weighted by a (low-pass) filter function given by F(t,f)=sinc2(πft). This result elucidates the connection between low-frequency noise and disorder in neuron dynamics. Under 1/f noise, spike dynamics lacks a characteristic correlation time, inducing the leaky and nonleaky models, to exhibit nonergodic behavior and the Fano factor, increasing logarithmically as a function of time. We compare our results to experimental data of single neurons in vivo [Teich, Heneghan, Lowen, Ozaki, and Kaplan, J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 14, 529 (1997)] and show how the 1/f noise model provides much better agreement than the usual approximations based on Lorentzian noise. The low-frequency noise, however, complicates the case for an information-coding scheme based on interspike intervals by introducing variability in the neuron response time. On a positive note, the neuron response time to a step stimulus is, remarkably, nearly optimal in the presence of 1/f noise. An explanation of this effect elucidates how the brain can take advantage of noise to prime a subset of the neurons to respond almost instantly to sudden stimuli.},doi = {10.1103/PhysRevE.83.051912},file = {:Sobie2011 - Neuron Dynamics in the Presence of 1_f Noise.pdf:PDF},keywords = {1/f noise},publisher = {American Physical Society ({APS})},}

The presence of 1f noise in the simplest systems such as beams of charged particles in vacuum, the existence of 1f noise in currents limited by the surface recombination rate, bulk recombination rate, or by the finite mobility determined by interaction with the phonons in solids, suggests a fundamental fluctuation of the corresponding elementary cross sections. This leads to fluctuations of the kinetic transport coefficients such as mobility μ or recombination speed, observable both in equilibrium and nonequilibrium. In the first case the available Johnson noise power kT, determined by the Nyquist theorem, is free of this type of 1f fluctuation. An elementary calculation is presented which shows that any cross section, or process rate, involving charged particles, exhibits 1f noise as an infrared phenomenon. For single-particle processes, the experimental value of Hooge's constant is obtained as an upper limit, corresponding to very large velocity changes of the current carriers, close to the speed of light. The obtained sin2(θ2) dependence on the mean scattering angle predicts much lower 1f noise for (low-angle) impurity scattering, showing a strong (∼μ2μ2latt) noise increase with temperature at the transition to lattice scattering. This is in qualitative agreement with measurements on thin films and on heavily doped semiconductors, or on manganin. The theory is based on the infrared quasidivergence present in all cross sections (and in some autocorrelation functions) due to interaction of the current carriers with massless infraquanta: photons, electron-hole pair excitations at metallic Fermi surfaces, generalized spin waves, transverse phonons, hydrodynamic excitations of other quanta, very low-energy excitations of quasidegenerate states observed, e.g., in disordered materials, at surfaces, or at lattice imperfections, etc. The observed 1f noise is the sum of these contributions, and can be used to detect and study new infraquanta.},doi = {10.1103/PhysRevA.22.745},file = {:Handel1980 - Quantum Approach To1_f Noise.pdf:PDF},keywords = {1/f noise},publisher = {American Physical Society ({APS})},}

These scaling properties suggest that the nonlinear regulatory systems are operating far from equilibrium, and that maintaining constancy is not the goal of physiologic control.

Application of fractal analysis may provide new approaches to assessing cardiac risk and forecasting sudden cardiac death, as well as to monitoring the aging process.

We define a taxonomy of orbits that hinges on a correspondence between periodic orbits and rational numbers. The taxonomy defines the entire dynamics, including aperiodic motion, since every orbit is in or near the periodic set. A remarkable implication of this periodic orbit taxonomy is that the simple precessing ellipse familiar from planetary orbits is not allowed in the strong-field regime. Instead, eccentric orbits trace out precessions of multileaf clovers in the final stages of inspiral. Furthermore, for any black hole, there is some point in the strong-field regime past which zoom-whirl behavior becomes unavoidable.

Here we show that such DPTs can be found in systems with few degrees of freedom; i.e., they can take place without resorting to the traditional thermodynamic limit. We illustrate this by showing the existence of the two types of DPTs in a quantum Rabi model—a system involving a spin-12 and a bosonic mode. The dynamical criticality appears in the limit of an infinitely large ratio of the spin frequency with respect to the bosonic one. We determine its dynamical phase diagram and study the long-time averaged order parameters, whose semiclassical approximation yields a jump at the transition point. We find the critical times at which the rate function becomes nonanalytical, showing its associated critical exponent as well as the corrections introduced by a finite frequency ratio.

With periodic boundary conditions, eight-vertex and Gaussian model operators are found. With the twisted boundary conditions, operators from the operator algebras of the Ashkin-Teller and q-state Potts models are identified.

Motivated by this nonequilibrium role, we present generic statistical properties of off-diagonal matrix elements of local observables in two families of interacting many-body systems with local interactions. Since integrability (or lack thereof) is an important ingredient in the relaxation process, we analyze models that can be continuously tuned to integrability. We show that, for generic nonintegrable systems, the distribution of off-diagonal matrix elements is a Gaussian centered at zero. As one approaches integrability, the peak around zero becomes sharper, so the distribution is approximately a combination of two Gaussians.

The principal idea of Bloch’s theory is the assumption that the interaction of a given electron with the other particles of the lattice may be replaced in first approximation by a periodic field of potential. With this model an interpretation of the specific heat, the electrical and thermal conductivity, the magnetic susceptibility, the Hall effect, and the optical properties of metals could be obtained. The advantages and limitations inherent in the assumption of Bloch will be much the same as those encountered when replacing the interaction of the electrons in an atom by a suitable central shielding of the unclear field, as in the work of Thomas and Hartree. In the papers quoted a number of general results were given regarding the behaviour of electrons in any periodic field of potential. To obtain a clearer idea of the details of this behaviour with a view to the application in special problems, however, it appeared worth while to investigate the mechanics of electrons in periodic fields of potential somewhat similar to those met with in practice and of such nature that the energy values W and eigenfunctions Ψ of the wave-equation can actually be computed. It is the purpose of this article to discuss a case where the integration is possible. In Section 1 the energy values and in Section 2 the wave-functions in their dependence on the binding introduced by the potential field are discussed for the one dimensional problem. In Section 3 the matrix elements of the linear momentum, which furnish the electric current associated with the various stationary states, are well as the probability of radiative transitions between these states, are evaluated. In Section 4 the results are extended to the three dimensional case and those features considered which one may expect to find in the case of more general periodic fields of potential.

In systems with scars, most eigenstates thermalize, but a few atypical scar states do not.

These models can be realized in any lattice that can be tiled by triangles, such as the triangular or kagome lattices, and have been shown to have close connections to the physics of quantum spin liquids in the Heisenberg kagome antiferromagnet. In this paper, we introduce a generalized family of n-colored Hamiltonians with “spiral colored” eigenstates made from n-spin motifs such as polygons or polyhedra. We show how these models can be realized in many different lattice geometries and provide numerical evidence that they can exhibit quantum many-body scars with periodic revivals that can be observed by time-evolving simple product states.

In the single-particle case, quantum scars correspond to wavefunctions that concentrate in the vicinity of unstable periodic classical trajectories. We show that many-body scars appear in the Fibonacci chain, a model with a constrained local Hilbert space that has recently been experimentally realized in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator.

We show that DPTs-I appear as a manifestation of symmetry restoration after a quench from the broken-symmetry phase, the limits between these two phases being demarcated precisely by an ESQPT. We describe the order parameters of DPTs-I with a generalization of the standard microcanonical ensemble incorporating the information of two additional conserved charges identifying the corresponding phase. We also show that DPTs-I are linked to a mechanism of information erasure brought about by the ESQPT, and quantify this information loss with the statistical ensemble that we propose. Finally, we show analytically the main mechanism for DPTs-II is forbidden in these systems for quenches leading a broken-symmetry initial state to the same broken-symmetry phase, on one side of the ESQPT, and we provide a formulation of DPTs-II depending on the side of the ESQPT where the quench ends. We analyze the connections between various indicators of DPTs-II.

We find that both the OTOC and Holevo information exhibit a linear light cone and periodic oscillations inside the light cone for initial states within the scarred subspace, which is in sharp contrast to thermal or many-body localized systems. The periodic revivals of OTOCs and Holevo information signify unusual breakdown of quantum chaos and are not equivalent to the revival dynamics of state fidelity or local observables studied in the previous literature. To explain the formation of the linear light-cone structure, we provide a perturbation-type calculation based on a phenomenological model.

The intraworld contributions reproduce the Altshuler-Aronov-Khmelnitskii dephasing (that would correspond to a decay of the correlator), while the interworld terms provide a term of the opposite sign that exceeds dephasing. Consequently, both regularized and unregularized OTOCs grow exponentially in time, but surprisingly we find that the corresponding many-body Lyapunov exponents are different. For the regularized correlator, we reproduce an earlier perturbation theory result for the Lyapunov exponent that satisfies the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound, λ(r)≤2πkBT/ℏ. However, the Lyapunov exponent of the unregularized correlator parametrically exceeds the bound, λ(u)≫2πkBT/ℏ. We argue that λ(u) is not a reliable indicator of many-body quantum chaos as it contains additional contributions from elastic scattering events due to virtual processes that should not contribute to many-body chaos. These results bring up an important general question of the physical meaning of the OTOCs often used in calculations and proofs. We briefly discuss possible connections of the OTOCs to observables in quantum interference effects and level statistics via a generalization of the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture to many-body chaotic systems.},doi = {10.1103/PhysRevB.98.205124},file = {:Liao2018 - Nonlinear Sigma Model Approach to Many Body Quantum Chaos_ Regularized and Unregularized Out of Time Ordered Correlators.pdf:PDF},keywords = {OTOC},publisher = {American Physical Society},shorttitle = {Nonlinear sigma model approach to many-body quantum chaos},url = {https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.98.205124},urldate = {2022-12-08},}@Article{Khemani2018,author = {Khemani, Vedika and Huse, David A. and Nahum, Adam},journal = {Physical Review B},title = {Velocity-dependent {Lyapunov} exponents in many-body quantum, semiclassical, and classical chaos},year = {2018},month = oct,number = {14},pages = {144304},volume = {98},abstract = {The exponential growth or decay with time of the out-of-time-order commutator (OTOC) is one widely used diagnostic of many-body chaos in spatially extended systems.

Using both quantum and classical arguments, we show that the OTOC’s growth rate and the Lyapunov exponent are, in general, distinct quantities, corresponding to the logarithm of the phase-space averaged divergence rate of classical trajectories and to the phase-space average of the logarithm, respectively. The difference appears to be more pronounced in the regime of low kicking strength K, where no classical chaos exists globally. In this case, the Lyapunov exponent quickly decreases as K→0, while the OTOC’s growth rate may decrease much slower, showing a higher sensitivity to small chaotic islands in the phase space. We also show that the quantum correlator as a function of time exhibits a clear singularity at the Ehrenfest time tE: transitioning from a time-independent value of t−1lnC(t) at t{\textless }tE to its monotonic decrease with time at t{\textgreater }tE.

We demonstrate this for the kicked quantum Ising model by using large-scale numerical results and an analytic solution in the integrable regime. In a generic case, we observe the growth of the OTOC density to be linear in time.

One way to characterize quantum scrambling is to measure an out-of-time-ordered correlation function (OTOC); however, because scrambling leads to their decay, OTOCs do not generally discriminate between quantum scrambling and ordinary decoherence.

In this scheme, each stretching degree of freedom is identified as an interacting Morse oscillator, with an associated U(2) dynamical algebra, and the doubly degenerate bending degree of freedom is modelled with a U(3) dynamical algebra, obtaining as a final result a reasonable set of force constants.},doi = {10.1016/j.jms.2008.10.001},file = {:SanchezCastellanos2009 - A Novel Connection between Algebraic Spectroscopic Parameters and Force Constants in the Description of Vibrational Excitations of Linear Triatomic Molecules.pdf:PDF},keywords = {Algebraic description, u(3) dynamical algebra, bending modes, linear molecules, carbon dioxide, vibron modelS},url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022285208002919},urldate = {2023-01-02},}@Article{BermudezMontana2020,author = {Bermúdez-Montaña, Marisol and Carvajal, Miguel and Pérez-Bernal, Francisco and Lemus, Renato},journal = {Journal of Raman Spectroscopy},title = {An algebraic alternative for the accurate simulation of {CO2} {Raman} spectra},year = {2020},issn = {1097-4555},number = {3},pages = {569--583},volume = {51},abstract = {We present an accurate simulation of the Raman spectrum of the carbon dioxide molecule in the 1150–1500 cm−1 spectral range, comparing the results obtained using the three polyad schemes found in the literature of this molecule.

In particular, it is enough to integrate just one perturbation to obtain two largest Lyapunov exponents, which enables to search for hyperchaos. Moreover, in the presented algorithm, only very basic mathematical operations such as summation, multiplication or division are applied, which boost the efficiency of computations. All these features together make the new method faster than any other known by the authors if the order of the system under consideration is low.

In recent years, there has been much effort to understand the process of thermalization in strongly interacting quantum systems that often lack an obvious semiclassical limit. The time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) allows one to systematically derive an effective classical (nonlinear) dynamical system by projecting unitary many-body dynamics onto a manifold of weakly entangled variational states. We demonstrate that such dynamical systems generally possess mixed phase space. When TDVP errors are small, the mixed phase space leaves a footprint on the exact dynamics of the quantum model. For example, when the system is initialized in a state belonging to a stable periodic orbit or the surrounding regular region, it exhibits persistent many-body quantum revivals. As a proof of principle, we identify new types of “quantum many-body scars,” i.e., initial states that lead to long-time oscillations in a model of interacting Rydberg atoms in one and two dimensions. Intriguingly, the initial states that give rise to most robust revivals are typically entangled states. On the other hand, even when TDVP errors are large, as in the thermalizing tilted-field Ising model, initializing the system in a regular region of phase space leads to a surprising slowdown of thermalization. Our work establishes TDVP as a method for identifying interacting quantum systems with anomalous dynamics in arbitrary dimensions. Moreover, the mixed phase space classical variational equations allow one to find slowly thermalizing initial conditions in interacting models. Our results shed light on a link between classical and quantum chaos, pointing toward possible extensions of the classical Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem to quantum systems.},comment = {https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0lVbgRN0r4230210 - Škultéty},doi = {10.1103/PhysRevX.10.011055},file = {:Michailidis2020 - Slow Quantum Thermalization and Many Body Revivals from Mixed Phase Space.pdf:PDF},keywords = {many-body quantum scar, Poincaré section, entanglement growth, thermalization rate, Lieb-Robinson bound},publisher = {American Physical Society},url = {https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.10.011055},urldate = {2023-02-10},}@Book{Tabor1989,author = {Tabor, Michael},publisher = {Wiley},title = {Chaos and integrability in nonlinear dynamics},year = {1989},isbn = {978-0-471-82728-3},file = {:Tabor1989 - Chaos and Integrability in Nonlinear Dynamics.pdf:PDF;:Tabor1989 - Chaos and Integrability in Nonlinear Dynamics.djvu:Djvu},pages = {364},subtitle = {an introduction},}@Book{Lorenz1995,author = {Lorenz, Edward N.},publisher = {University of Washington Press},title = {The {Essence} of {Chaos}},year = {1995},isbn = {9780295975146},file = {:Lorenz1995 - The Essence of Chaos.pdf:PDF},url = {https://uwapress.uw.edu/book/9780295975146/the-essence-of-chaos},urldate = {2023-02-13},}@Book{Ott2002,author = {Ott, Edward},publisher = {Cambridge University Press},title = {Chaos in Dynamical Systems},year = {2002},address = {Cambridge},edition = {2},isbn = {9780521010849},month = {aug},abstract = {Over the past two decades scientists, mathematicians, and engineers have come to understand that a large variety of systems exhibit complicated evolution with time.

For example, heat can be extracted from a negative-temperature reservoir with no other effect than the performance of an equivalent amount of work. One of the standard formulations of the second law of thermodynamics must be altered to the following: It is impossible to construct an engine that will operate in a closed cycle and provide no effect other than (1) the extraction of heat from a positive-temperature reservoir with the performance of an equivalent amount of work or (2) the rejection of heat into a negative-temperature reservoir with the corresponding work being done on the engine.

It concentrates on predictions based on self-consistent mean-field calculations, which can be considered as an approximate realization of an exact energy density functional (EDF). EDFs are derived from effective interactions commonly fitted to nuclear masses, charge radii and, in many cases, also to pseudo-data such as nuclear matter properties. Although in a model dependent way, EDFs constitute nowadays a unique tool to reliably and consistently access bulk ground state and collective excited state properties of atomic nuclei along the nuclear chart as well as the EoS. For comparison, some emphasis is also given to the results obtained with the so called ab initio approaches that aim at describing the nuclear EoS based on interactions fitted to few-body data only. Bridging the existent gap between these two frameworks will be essential since it may allow to improve our understanding on the diverse phenomenology observed in nuclei. Examples on observations from astrophysical objects and processes sensitive to the nuclear EoS are also briefly discussed. As the main conclusion, the isospin dependence of the nuclear EoS around saturation density and, to a lesser extent, the nuclear matter incompressibility remain to be accurately determined. Experimental and theoretical efforts in finding and measuring observables specially sensitive to the EoS properties are of paramount importance, not only for low-energy nuclear physics but also for nuclear astrophysics applications.},doi = {10.1016/j.ppnp.2018.04.001},file = {:RocaMaza2018 - Nuclear Equation of State from Ground and Collective Excited State Properties of Nuclei.pdf:PDF},keywords = {Nuclear equation of state, Energy density functional, Nuclear ground state, Nuclear collective states, Giant resonances},language = {en},url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0146641018300334},urldate = {2023-04-17},}@Book{Wimberger2023,author = {Sandro Wimberger},publisher = {Springer International Publishing AG},title = {Nonlinear Dynamics and Quantum Chaos},year = {2023},isbn = {978-3-031-01249-5},month = jan,series = {Graduate Texts in Physics},doi = {https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-01249-5},file = {:Wimberger2023 - Nonlinear Dynamics and Quantum Chaos.pdf:PDF},keywords = {quantum chaos},subtitle = {An Introduction},}@Article{Pechukas1983,author = {Pechukas, Philip},journal = {Physical Review Letters},title = {Distribution of {Energy} {Eigenvalues} in the {Irregular} {Spectrum}},year = {1983},month = sep,number = {11},pages = {943--946},volume = {51},abstract = {The distribution of energy eigenvalues in the irregular spectrum is derived in the semiclassical limit ℏ→0 by use of a plausible assumption on the spatial distribution of the corresponding eigenfunctions.},doi = {10.1103/PhysRevLett.51.943},file = {:Pechukas1983 - Distribution of Energy Eigenvalues in the Irregular Spectrum.pdf:PDF},keywords = {Pechucas-Yukawa gas},publisher = {American Physical Society},url = {https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.51.943},urldate = {2023-04-18},}@Article{Yukawa1985,author = {Yukawa, T.},journal = {Physical Review Letters},title = {New {Approach} to the {Statistical} {Properties} of {Energy} {Levels}},year = {1985},month = apr,number = {17},pages = {1883--1886},volume = {54},abstract = {The joint distribution of energy eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian is derived by means of the usual statistical laws of classical many-body systems.

The wave function obeys the Wheeler-DeWitt second-order functional differential equation. We put forward a proposal for the wave function of the "ground state" or state of minimum excitation: the ground-state amplitude for a three-geometry is given by a path integral over all compact positive-definite four-geometries which have the three-geometry as a boundary. The requirement that the Hamiltonian be Hermitian then defines the boundary conditions for the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and the spectrum of possible excited states. To illustrate the above, we calculate the ground and excited states in a simple minisuperspace model in which the scale factor is the only gravitational degree of freedom, a conformally invariant scalar field is the only matter degree of freedom and Λ{\textgreater }0. The ground state corresponds to de Sitter space in the classical limit. There are excited states which represent universes which expand from zero volume, reach a maximum size, and then recollapse but which have a finite (though very small) probability of tunneling through a potential barrier to a de Sitter-type state of continual expansion. The path-integral approach allows us to handle situations in which the topology of the three-manifold changes.

The models assume homogeneous, isotropic, closed spacetime geometries, a single scalar field moving in a quadratic potential, and a fundamental cosmological constant. The allowed classical histories and their probabilities are calculated to leading semiclassical order. For the most realistic range of parameters analyzed, we find that a minimum amount of scalar field is required, if there is any at all, in order for the Universe to behave classically at late times. If the classical late time histories are extended back, they may be singular or bounce at a finite radius. The ensemble of classical histories is time symmetric although individual histories are generally not. The no-boundary proposal selects inflationary histories, but the measure on the classical solutions it provides is heavily biased towards small amounts of inflation. However, the probability for a large number of e-foldings is enhanced by the volume factor needed to obtain the probability for what we observe in our past light cone, given our present age.

Given a certain physical system, it is of interest to understand which properties of the system account for the presence, or the absence, of a phase transition, and an investigation of these properties may lead to a deeper understanding of the physical phenomenon. One possible way to approach this problem, reviewed and discussed in the present paper, is the study of topology changes in configuration space which are found to be related to equilibrium phase transitions in classical statistical mechanical systems. For the study of configuration space topology, one considers the subsets Mv, consisting of all points from configuration space with a potential energy per particle equal to or less than a given v. For finite systems, topology changes of Mv are intimately related to nonanalytic points of the microcanonical entropy. In the thermodynamic limit, a more complex relation between nonanalytic points of thermodynamic functions (i.e., phase transitions) and topology changes is observed. For some class of short-range systems, a topology change of the Mv at v=vt was proven to be necessary, but not sufficient, for a phase transition to take place at a potential energy vt. In contrast, phase transitions in systems with long-range interactions or in systems with nonconfining potentials need not be accompanied by such a topology change. Instead, for such systems the nonanalytic point in a thermodynamic function is found to have some maximization procedure at its origin. These results may foster insight into the mechanisms which lead to the occurrence of a phase transition, and thus may help to explore the origin of this physical phenomenon.},doi = {10.1103/RevModPhys.80.167},file = {:Kastner2008 - Phase Transitions and Configuration Space Topology.pdf:PDF},publisher = {American Physical Society},url = {https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/RevModPhys.80.167},urldate = {2023-06-02},}@Book{Mehta2004,author = {Mehta, Madan Lal},publisher = {Elsevier, Academic Press},title = {Random Matrices, Volume 142, Third Edition (Pure and Applied Mathematics)},year = {2004},isbn = {9780120884094},doi = {10.1016/C2009-0-22297-5},file = {:Mehta2004 - Random Matrices, Volume 142, Third Edition (Pure and Applied Mathematics).pdf:PDF},pages = {706},}@Article{Cejnar2006a,author = {Cejnar, Pavel and Macek, Michal and Heinze, Stefan and Jolie, Jan and Dobeš, Jan},journal = {Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General},title = {Monodromy and excited-state quantum phase transitions in integrable systems: collective vibrations of nuclei},year = {2006},issn = {0305-4470},number = {31},pages = {L515},volume = {39},abstract = {Quantum phase transitions affecting the structure of ground and excited states of integrable systems with the Mexican-hat type potential are shown to be related to a singular torus of classical orbits passing the point of unstable equilibrium.

Thus the problem of finding eigenvalues can be greatly simplified by the additional integrals of the motion which are present if the Hamiltonian is constructed so as to commute with invariants of the group. In the present case, the model consists of N fermions distributed in two N-fold degenerate levels and interacting via a monopole-monopole force. It is shown that the model Hamiltonian is easily expressed in terms of quasi-spin operators and exact eigenvalues are obtained.

The principal device employed, as in part I, is the projection operator which selects the open channel components of the wave function. It is found that the formal structure of part I providing a unified description for direct and compound nuclear reactions including the coupled equation description for direct reactions remains valid in this wider context. A Kapur-Peierls expansion may also be readily obtained. The concept of channel radii is not needed nor is any decomposition of the wave function for the system into angular momentum eigenstates required, so that the expressions for transition amplitudes and widths are invariant with respect to the angular momentum coupling scheme. Since the open channels can only be defined in an asymptotic sense, the corresponding projection operators are not unique. As a consequence the projection operator method has a flexibility which in the first place is consonant with the wide range of phenomena which can occur in nuclear reactions and in the second place can effectively exploit an intuitive understanding of the phenomena. Example of projection operators are obtained including one which leads to the Wigner-Eisenbud formalism, another which is appropriate for the stripping reaction, and, finally, one which takes the Pauli exclusion principle into account.

This review discusses similar physics that emerges in open and marginally stable quantum many-body systems. In the presence of open decay channels, the intrinsic states are coupled through the continuum. At sufficiently strong continuum coupling, the spectrum of resonances undergoes restructuring with segregation of very broad super-radiant states and trapping of remaining long-lived compound states. The appropriate formalism describing this phenomenon is based on the Feshbach projection method and effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. A broader generalization is related to the idea of doorway states connecting quantum states of different structures. The method is explained in detail and examples of applications are given to nuclear, atomic and particle physics. The interrelation of the collective dynamics through continuum and possible intrinsic many-body chaos is studied, including universal mesoscopic conductance fluctuations.

The study of such systems represents a core problem in modern physics that has evolved to assume an unprecedented interdisciplinary character. OQSs consist of some localized, microscopic, region that is coupled to an external environment by means of an appropriate interaction. Examples of such systems may be found in numerous areas of physics, including atomic and nuclear physics, photonics, biophysics, and mesoscopic physics. It is the latter area that provides the main focus of this review, an emphasis that is driven by the capacity that exists to subject mesoscopic devices to unprecedented control. We thus provide a detailed discussion of the behavior of mesoscopic devices (and other OQSs) in terms of the projection-operator formalism, according to which the system under study is considered to be comprised of a localized region (Q), embedded into a well-defined environment (P) of scattering wavefunctions (with Q + P = 1). The Q subspace must be treated using the concepts of non-Hermitian physics, and of particular interest here is: the capacity of the environment to mediate a coupling between the different states of Q; the role played by the presence of exceptional points (EPs) in the spectra of OQSs; the influence of EPs on the rigidity of the wavefunction phases, and; the ability of EPs to initiate a dynamical phase transition (DPT). EPs are singular points in the continuum, at which two resonance states coalesce, that is where they exhibit a non-avoided crossing. DPTs occur when the quantum dynamics of the open system causes transitions between non-analytically connected states, as a function of some external control parameter. Much like conventional phase transitions, the behavior of the system on one side of the DPT does not serve as a reliable indicator of that on the other. In addition to discussing experiments on mesoscopic quantum point contacts that provide evidence of the environmentally-mediated coupling of quantum states, we also review manifestations of DPTs in mesoscopic devices and other systems. These experiments include observations of resonance-trapping behavior in microwave cavities and open quantum dots, phase lapses in tunneling through single-electron transistors, and spin swapping in atomic ensembles. Other possible manifestations of this phenomenon are presented, including various superradiant phenomena in low-dimensional semiconductors. From these discussions a generic picture of OQSs emerges in which the environmentally-mediated coupling between different quantum states plays a critical role in governing the system behavior. The ability to control or manipulate this interaction may even lead to new applications in photonics and electronics.},doi = {10.1088/0034-4885/78/11/114001},publisher = {IOP Publishing},shorttitle = {A review of progress in the physics of open quantum systems},url = {https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0034-4885/78/11/114001},urldate = {2023-08-22},}@Article{Bender1998,author = {Bender, Carl M. and Boettcher, Stefan},journal = {Physical Review Letters},title = {Real {Spectra} in {Non}-{Hermitian} {Hamiltonians} {Having} {PT} {Symmetry}},year = {1998},month = jun,number = {24},pages = {5243--5246},volume = {80},abstract = {The condition of self-adjointness ensures that the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian are real and bounded below.

This generalization of Hermiticity is investigated using a complex deformation H=p2+x2(ix)ε of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian, where ε is a real parameter. The system exhibits two phases: When ε⩾0, the energy spectrum of H is real and positive as a consequence of 𝒫𝒯 symmetry. However, when −1<ε<0, the spectrum contains an infinite number of complex eigenvalues and a finite number of real, positive eigenvalues because 𝒫𝒯 symmetry is spontaneously broken. The phase transition that occurs at ε=0 manifests itself in both the quantum-mechanical system and the underlying classical system. Similar qualitative features are exhibited by complex deformations of other standard real Hamiltonians H=p2+x2N(ix)ε with N integer and ε>−N; each of these complex Hamiltonians exhibits a phase transition at ε=0. These 𝒫𝒯-symmetric theories may be viewed as analytic continuations of conventional theories from real to complex phase space.},doi = {10.1063/1.532860},file = {:Bender1999 - PT Symmetric Quantum Mechanics.pdf:PDF},url = {https://doi.org/10.1063/1.532860},urldate = {2023-08-22},}@Book{Levine1969,author = {Levine, Raphael D.},publisher = {Clarendon P.},title = {Quantum mechanics of molecular rate processes},year = {1969},isbn = {9780198553434},pages = {335},}@Article{Wigner1955,author = {Wigner, Eugene P.},journal = {Physical Review},title = {Lower {Limit} for the {Energy} {Derivative} of the {Scattering} {Phase} {Shift}},year = {1955},month = apr,number = {1},pages = {145--147},volume = {98},abstract = {It is shown that the derivative of the scattering phase shift with respect to energy, dηdE, must exceed a certain limit if the interaction of scattered particle and scatterer vanishes beyond a certain distance.

Such systems must possess separable solutions to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in more than one coordinate system. There are 11 coordinate systems for which the Hamilton-Jacobi equation separates in openR3. One coordinate system may be arbitrarily rotated or translated with respect to the other, yielding 66 distinct cases. In each case, the differential equations for separability in the two coordinates are integrated to give a complete list of all superintegrable potentials with four or five quadratic integrals. The tables—which may be consulted independently of the main body of the paper—list the distinct superintegrable potentials, the separating coordinates, and the isolating integrals of the motion. If there exist five isolating integrals, then all finite classical trajectories are closed; if only four, then the trajectories are restricted to two-dimensional surface.

It arose following the discovery in 1932 of a suprising new phase transition in liquid helium, the “lambda transition,” when W. H. Keesom and coworkers in Leiden, Holland observed a λhaped “jump” discontinuity in the curve giving the temperature dependence of the specific heat of helium at a critical value. This apparent jump led Ehrenfest to introduce a classification of phase transitions on the basis of jumps in derivatives of the free energy function. This classification was immediately applied by A.J. Rutgers to the study of the transition from the normal to superconducting state in metals. Eduard Justi and Max von Laue soon questioned the possibility of its class of “second-order phase transitions” -- of which the “lambda transition was believed to be the arche type -- but C.J. Gorter and H.B.G. Casimir used an “order parameter to demonstrate their existence in superconductors. As a crossroads of study, the Ehrenfest classification was forced to undergo a slow, adaptive evolution during subsequent decades. During the 1940s the classification was increasingly used in discussions of liquid-gas, order-disorder, paramagnetic-ferromagnetic and normal-super-conducting phase transitions. Already in 1944 however, Lars Onsagers solution of the Ising model for two-dimensional magnets was seen to possess a derivative with a logarithmic divergence rather than a jump as the critical point was approached. In the 1950s, experiments further revealed the lambda transition in helium to exhibit similar behavior. Rather than being a prime example of an Ehrenfest phase transition, the lambda transition was seen to lie outside the Ehrenfest classification. The Ehrenfest scheme was then extended to include such singularities, most notably by A. Brain Pippard in 1957, with widespread acceptance. During the 1960s these logarithmic infinities were the focus of the investigation of “scaling” by Leo Kadanoff, B. Widom and others. By the 1970s, a radically simplified binary classification of phase transitions into “first-order” and “continuous” transitions was increasingly adopted.},comment = {231020 - Lukáš Honsa - zkouška, Ehrenfestova klasifikace fázových přechodů},doi = {10.1007/s004070050021},file = {:Jaeger1998 - The Ehrenfest Classification of Phase Transitions_ Introduction and Evolution.pdf:PDF},keywords = {Phase Transition, Free Energy, Helium, Ising Model, Liquid Helium},shorttitle = {The {Ehrenfest} {Classification} of {Phase} {Transitions}},url = {https://doi.org/10.1007/s004070050021},urldate = {2023-09-01},}@Article{Baden2014,author = {Baden, Markus P. and Arnold, Kyle J. and Grimsmo, Arne L. and Parkins, Scott and Barrett, Murray D.},journal = {Physical Review Letters},title = {Realization of the {Dicke} {Model} {Using} {Cavity}-{Assisted} {Raman} {Transitions}},year = {2014},month = jul,number = {2},pages = {020408},volume = {113},abstract = {We realize an open version of the Dicke model by coupling two hyperfine ground states using two cavity-assisted Raman transitions.

As a result, the states in the region with positive thermal energy cannot be thermally populated because their negligible probability, making that energy region thermally unreachable at finite temperatures. The quantum phase transitions of the lowest energy states, from a normal to a superradiant phase, produce the thermal transition. The other critical phenomena, the ESQPTs occurring at excited energies, have no manifestation in the thermodynamics, although their effects could be seen in finite size corrections. A new superradiant phase is found, which only exists in the generalized model, and can be relevant in finite size systems.},doi = {10.1088/1742-5468/2016/09/093105},language = {en},publisher = {IOP Publishing and SISSA},shorttitle = {Thermal and quantum phase transitions in atom-field systems},url = {https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-5468/2016/09/093105},urldate = {2023-09-05},}@Article{PerezFernandez2017,author = {Pérez-Fernández, P. and Relaño, A.},journal = {Physical Review E},title = {From thermal to excited-state quantum phase transition: {The} {Dicke} model},year = {2017},month = jul,number = {1},pages = {012121},volume = {96},abstract = {We study the thermodynamics of the full version of the Dicke model, including all the possible values of the total angular momentum j, with both microcanonical and canonical ensembles.

Here we initiate the study of “operator spreading” in quantum maps on a torus, systems which do not have a tensor-product Hilbert space or a notion of spatial locality. Using the perturbed Arnold cat map as an example, we analytically compare and contrast the evolutions of functions on classical phase space and quantum operator evolutions, and identify distinct timescales that characterize the dynamics of operators in quantum chaotic maps. Until an Ehrenfest time, the quantum system exhibits classical chaos, i.e., it mimics the behavior of the corresponding classical system. After an operator scrambling time, the operator looks “random” in the initial basis, a characteristic feature of quantum chaos. These timescales can be related to the quasienergy spectrum of the unitary via the spectral form factor. Furthermore, we show examples of “emergent classicality” in quantum problems far away from the classical limit.

Still-water systems like CWs and Maya reservoirs can become stagnant and nonpotable due to the build-up of nutrients that promote algal growth. Stagnant waters also serve as breeding grounds for mosquitoes that spread endemic diseases. CWs keep water clean via certain aquatic plants since all plants uptake nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus) and decomposing plant matter supports microbial biofilms that break down nutrients. CWs also support diverse zooplankton that prey on pathogens and bacteria that assist to denitrify water. CWs do not require the use of chemicals or fossil fuels and after the initial labor-intensive output become self-cleaning and self-sufficient with some maintenance. I posit that the Maya used a diverse array of aquatic plants and other biota to keep water clean in the same manner as do CWs, which I demonstrate using evidence from excavations and settlement maps, sediment cores and current wetlands, and the iconographic and hieroglyphic records.

Specific-heat measurements were made deep in the asymptotic region to within 2 nK of the transition. No evidence of rounding was found to this resolution. The optimum value of the critical exponent describing the specific-heat singularity was found to be α=−0.0127±0.0003.

The probability that a particle will be found to have a path x(t) lying somewhere within a region of space time is the square of a sum of contributions, one from each path in the region. The contribution from a single path is postulated to be an exponential whose (imaginary) phase is the classical action (in units of ℏ) for the path in question. The total contribution from all paths reaching x, t from the past is the wave function ψ(x, t). This is shown to satisfy Schroedinger's equation. The relation to matrix and operator algebra is discussed. Applications are indicated, in particular to eliminate the coordinates of the field oscillators from the equations of quantum electrodynamics.},doi = {10.1103/RevModPhys.20.367},file = {:Feynman1948 - Space Time Approach to Non Relativistic Quantum Mechanics.pdf:PDF},publisher = {American Physical Society},url = {https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/RevModPhys.20.367},urldate = {2023-11-08},}@Article{KhaloufRivera2021,author = {Jamil Khalouf-Rivera and Francisco Pérez-Bernal and Miguel Carvajal},journal = {Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer},title = {Excited state quantum phase transitions in the bending spectra of molecules},year = {2021},issn = {0022-4073},month = mar,pages = {107436},volume = {261},abstract = {We present an extension of the Hamiltonian of the two dimensional limit of the vibron model to encompass all possible interactions up to four-body operators.

As a result, the eigenstates of these observables decohere and behave like classical states: Continuous destruction of superpositions leads to environment-induced superselection (einselection). Here I investigate it in the context of quantum chaos (i.e., quantum dynamics of systems which are classically chaotic). I show that the evolution of a chaotic macroscopic (but, ultimately, quantum) system is not just difficult to predict (requiring an accuracy exponentially increasing with time) but quickly ceases to be deterministic in principle as a result of the Heisenberg indeterminacy (which limits the resolution available in the initial conditions). This happens after a time tℏ which is only logarithmic in the Planck constant. A definitely macroscopic (if somewhat outrageous) example is afforded by various components of the solar system which are chaotic, with the Lyapunov timescales ranging from a bit more than a month (Hyperion) to millions of years (planetary system as a whole). On the timescale tℏ the initial minimum uncertainty wavepackets corresponding to celestial bodies would be smeared over distances of the order of radii of their orbits into "Schrödinger cat – like" states, and the concept of a trajectory would cease to apply. In reality, such paradoxical states are eliminated by decoherence which helps restore quantum-classical correspondence. The price for the recovery of classicality is the loss of predictability: In the classical limit (associated with effective decoherence, and not just with the smallness of ℏ) the rate of increase of the von Neumann entropy of the decohering system is independent of the strength of the coupling to the environment, and equal to the sum of the positive Lyapunov exponents. Algorithmic aspects of entropy production are briefly explored to illustrate the effect of decoherence from the point of view of the observer. We show that "decoherence strikes twice", introducing unpredictability into the system and extracting quantum coherence from the observers memory, where it enters as a price for the classicality of his records.},comment = {Hyperion},doi = {10.1238/Physica.Topical.076a00186},file = {:Zurek1998 - Decoherence, Chaos, Quantum Classical Correspondence, and the Algorithmic Arrow of Time.pdf:PDF},language = {en},publisher = {IOP Publishing},url = {https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1238/Physica.Topical.076a00186/meta},urldate = {2024-02-09},}@Article{Sieberer2019,author = {Sieberer, Lukas M. and Olsacher, Tobias and Elben, Andreas and Heyl, Markus and Hauke, Philipp and Haake, Fritz and Zoller, Peter},journal = {npj Quantum Information},title = {Digital quantum simulation, {Trotter} errors, and quantum chaos of the kicked top},year = {2019},issn = {2056-6387},month = sep,number = {1},pages = {1--11},volume = {5},abstract = {This work aims at giving Trotter errors in digital quantum simulation (DQS) of collective spin systems an interpretation in terms of quantum chaos of the kicked top.
